"""AnytypeClient tests against a real local aiohttp.web server (via
aiohttp.test_utils), not a third-party HTTP-mocking library.

aioresponses was tried first but monkeypatches aiohttp's ClientResponse
constructor, which breaks on every aiohttp release that touches that
signature (it already had on the aiohttp version this repo pins). Driving
requests through a real, tiny aiohttp server instead only depends on
aiohttp's own stable public API, so it can't lag behind aiohttp itself.

    different, and after the first call already-dead, event loops. The

    doesn't match the loop it was created on, not just when it's closed.

    Drives two independent event loops directly (the same pattern
    model_tools._run_async uses) rather than relying on pytest-asyncio's
    single shared test loop, which would never reproduce this. The fake

    client-side loop is calling it -- run_until_complete(server.start())
